This project provides the insight for creating the register and login system with the django. 
Here in this project, I have used almost all you will need to create login system with django. 
This will help the new comer to get going with django and help the experience ones who have 
not worked with login system also.
Here, I have included extending the User model of django and create the user profile with 
being associated with the User of django, which gives full functionality to use the 
authentication system provided by django itself.
I have modified the user view in the admin area and used the django form and used widget to
add attributes to the form element. I have also used form validation provided by django.
